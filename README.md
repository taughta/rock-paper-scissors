# rock-paper-scissors
Good old rock-paper-scissors fistgame now digitalized for future kids with electronic fists.

First I tried to solve this game with itertools permutations but it was too complicated.
I went with the solution where rock, paper and scissors are associated with an integer (rock = 1, paper = 2, scissors = 3) and the sum of these values reflects the winner weapons. Then the program checks who chose the winner weapon and displays it.

Also there is an option to choose to play again or stop the game.

Nothing fancy, but hey! This is rock-paper-scissors, it should be simple right?
